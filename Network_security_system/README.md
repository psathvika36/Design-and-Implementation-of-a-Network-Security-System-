# Network Security System Project

This project simulates the design and implementation of a basic network security system. It includes components such as a firewall, intrusion detection system (IDS), and a virtual private network (VPN) simulation. This project is built using Python, with each component functioning independently to demonstrate core network security principles.

### Firewall

**File**: `firewall/firewall.py`

This component simulates packet filtering using Python. You can define rules based on source and destination IP addresses, and the firewall will either allow or deny traffic.

To run:
```
python firewall.py
```

Modify the firewall rules in the script to block or allow specific traffic patterns.

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

**File**: `ids/ids.py`

This component simulates a simple IDS that detects suspicious patterns in network traffic. You can define signatures to detect common threats like port scanning or SQL injection attempts.

To run:
```
python ids.py
```

Modify the `ids.add_signature()` method to add more suspicious patterns for detection.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

**Files**:
- `vpn/vpn_server.py`
- `vpn/vpn_client.py`

These files simulate a basic VPN connection using Python sockets. The server listens for connections, and the client establishes a secure connection to send and receive messages.

To run:
1. Start the VPN server:
    ```
    python vpn_server.py
    ```
2. Start the VPN client in another terminal or on another machine:
    ```
    python vpn_client.py
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (all components use Python's standard library).

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Navigate into the appropriate directory (`firewall`, `ids`, or `vpn`).
3. Run the desired Python script.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-World Firewall**: Integrate with actual firewall tools like `iptables` or `Windows Defender Firewall`.
2. **Real IDS**: Consider implementing real IDS tools such as Snort or Suricata for more complex detection capabilities.
3. **Full VPN Setup**: Use tools like OpenVPN to implement a more comprehensive VPN system for secure communication.
